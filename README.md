# A Library System
## Project Description
The goal of the project is to design a Library System Database including membership, book, author information and their relationship using SQL. It also  built an Interface to interact with Library Database using Python and implemented functions including borrowing, returning, and reserving books, genera ting reports, etc. 

The project could be divided to three parts: interface design, database implement and the connection between interface and database. It used tkinter package tool to build interface and use Data Definition Language to build database logic in MySQL. The most difficult part was to link the interface with database.
